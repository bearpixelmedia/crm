- âœ… **Clients** tab â†’ Will read columns A-G (ID, Name, Contact, Email, Phone, Status, Value)
- âœ… **Projects** tab â†’ Will read columns A-I (ID, Name, ClientId, Type, Status, StartDate, Deadline, Description, Budget)
- âœ… **Agents** tab â†’ Will read columns A-G (ID, Name, Email, Phone, Specialties, Capacity, CurrentWorkload)
- âœ… **Tasks** tab â†’ Will read columns A-K (ID, Title, Description, ProjectId, AssignedAgentId, Status, Priority, DueDate, EstimatedHours, ActualHours, CreatedDate)

### 2. **Optional New Features (Add Only If You Want)**
If you want the new features, just add these tabs to your existing sheet:

- **Invoices** tab â†’ For billing features
- **Reports** tab â†’ For automated reporting
